I will have to know how to create hitboxes and attack methods so the enemies
don't go through walls and can damage the player. Also hitboxes so when you 
collect the items, you can get score, if they give any. And hitboxes to 
have a "portal" or checkpoints for the player to go to the next level of the 
game/dungeon.
