It is a program to write down code, like java.
Assembly is faster than java, and requires fewer lines of code.
Assembly is different to java cause it's not portable, it's more difficult to learn to code in assembly than it is in java.
high-level language programs are portable and faster than low-level programs.
Java is a high-level and low-level. I can tell cause in java, there are lots of code needed to make something, but it programs the code faster than most code programmers.
Assembly is also high and low-level. I can tell because it requires a lot less code than java, but it is not portable like java is.
