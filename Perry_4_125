I could've completed my game if I didn't miss the days of where we took notes on
how to code for the game. Also, if I could've worked on it at home, i wouldn't
miss the info/complete date, cause i would be able to have extra time to
complete it. But since i could not work on it at home cause i dont have netbeans,
i couldnt complete my game in time.
