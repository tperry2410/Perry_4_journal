I will use static void, which will allow me to tell the player when the game
ends or when they win.
I will use static void to ask if they want to play a game or not.
I will use a while loop for a knife for when they have to kill the monster, or
get killed by the moster.
I will use a a static void so they can decide weither to pick up a flashlight or
go into the next room (with door wide open) that is pitch dark and have to find
a way out of the room.
I will use a static void to let the player pick a bloody note up or to leave
it where it is.
