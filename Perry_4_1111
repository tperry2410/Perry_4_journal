In my game, the player must choose the correct path to find his/her way 
through a nightmare maze, if he makes on mistake, theres a different thing that
happens. But if you can find the way to the end, then you win the game.
In order to track their progress, the game doesn't allow you to change 
directions in the option you pick, like if you move forward but want to go back,
there is a penalty to it, or death in this case.
