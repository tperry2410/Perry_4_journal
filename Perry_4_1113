I'll use the while loop to show that if the person has a flashlight, they will
be able to see, but if they didn't have one, it would be pitch dark and you'd 
have to feel around to make your way through the game.
Using methods in my game will let me to use my while loop by placing the
flashlight, their health, and items they've picked up, to help me with my while
loops.
