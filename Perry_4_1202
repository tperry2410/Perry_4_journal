I was successful in making my game cause I was able to make win/lose endings.
I was able to create my enemies and "hero", or items, that helps the player
complete the game.
I didn't make 5 methods, but I was able to complete a few
methods for the game.
I created many different win/lose endings, each win ending had a acheivement,
and whenever you win, you got the acheivement, if you wanted to, you could
go back and complete the other win endings to gather the other acheivements.
