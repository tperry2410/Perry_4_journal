Arduino uses "void loop" while c programming language uses "if()".
Arduino uses "digitalWriting" while you won't see those in a C programmed language.
Arduino and C programming languages both use "void" for a few statements.
I haven't made any code adaptations to date yet.
A circuit requires a 5v wire and a GND wire towards positive/negative.
They are all seperated in "File-Examples."
The projects me and my partner completed were circuit_01-06. In circuit 1, we
learned how to make a led light flash with the code. Whenever using the pins, 
you need a "pinMode()" in the code which will allow you to use either "output"
or "input', but in this code we used output, so we use a "digitalWrite()" to
command that pin to turn on at high power or low. In Circuit 2, we learned how
a potentiometer controls the rate of how much a led blinks depending on how
much light it receives. Circuit 3 was the coolest one that we did. We learned 
that using code, we can control the leds rate and brihgtness for the different 
colors that were blinking throught the led. Circuit 4 was also a cool one
because we got to make lights flash in a random, fashion order using the
"index = random(8)" code. Circuit 5 was a push button and light comes on or
off. Circuit 6 was an example of how bright you can make the led light be when
you have your hand over the photo resistor. These are the neat things that me
and my partner did last week, hopefully we will continue and complete with the
entire book that has a lot more things for us to do.
