My game will end in many different ways, some dying, and some, winning the
game. There will be a monster that kills you in one hit, but in some other
room, there will be a monster that knocks you out and you will spawn some
place else and not knowing how to get out and you have to get out before the
entire room you spawn in is filled with poisonous gas.
The only item in the game will be a lanturn, you either grab it out of the chest
or you leave it and continue to the next room.
