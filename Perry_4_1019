I was absent when it was assigned and so I check "d22.data" and looked in the
journal, now yes i found it, but what it was was an animation code, not for
the art. so i copied and pasted that and i thought we had to do something 
like that, but then Davis told us that it had to be a picture, not animation.
But if i was there when it was assigned, i would have tried making triangles
making a swirl around the screen untill no more triangles could go on the
screen.
