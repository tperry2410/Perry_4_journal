Questions from last slide.
I've seen this license from many different programs.  What I think it is saying is that the 
program is free and you can use it in your own way. This license is
implicating that the author and the user can both go to this website to get a
license, if they haven't already, and be able to use the website or program
in their own way. I would use this program when I want to talk about copyright
or something in that sorta of way. I wouldn't use this license if it is for
merchantability or fitness for a purticular purpose.
The underline message of the GPL is that it has to be open source.
